We regret the idea that this phenomenon is part of a "natural circle" or some kind a "natural disaster"; on the contrary, it's completely man-made, it's dangereous and most importantly it's preventable. We collect data about the causes and current situation about global warming and we publish weekly and quarterly reports about it. If you want to contribute our reports feel free to get in touch with us and if you want to join our network please fill a form and send to us. </p>

        <h2>What is global warming?</h2>
        <p>Global warming, also referred to as climate change, is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record which extends back to the mid-19th century, and in paleoclimate proxy records covering thousands of years.

In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded that "It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century." The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7 째C (0.5 to 3.1 째F) in the lowest emissions scenario, and 2.6 to 4.8 째C (4.7 to 8.6 째F) in the highest emissions scenario. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.</p>
